The program that sits between the services and the service manager.

# What is nyaa-init?
nyaa-init is a WIP (Work In Progress) program that sits between the service manager and the services you use. Think of it as a service manager for a service manager.
`init/service manager <-> nyaa-init <-> service`
The services are written in nyaa-init with a custom format, and nyaa-init takes care of the rest.

# Supported init systems
